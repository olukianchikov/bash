# Scripts to download backup files from remote servers.
# This include main server's backups and database dumps.
# get_bckup.sh uses 'settings' file that is in the same
# directory with the script. You can use -a [ip_address]
# key along with -u [user] and -c [remote_config_file]
# in get_bckup.sh. The script connects to remote
# machine, searches for .settings file in remote user's
# directory. In that file there should be information
# on where main_backup directory on that system and
# db_backup (if required).
# All backups saved in temporary path locally (see .settins)
# Then burning cd starts it's operation.
