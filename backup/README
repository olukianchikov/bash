# Here are backup scripts.
#
#   bckup.sh
#   db_bckup.sh
#   list_file (to be filled by user)
#   .settings file
#
#
# bckup.sh does not need any arguments. It uses .settings file to determine where
# system files backup should be stored and what are maximum limits.
# It uses list_file, searched in the very same directory, to determine what files
# and directories to save. So, any file and directory mentioned in list_file will be
# saved in backup. One file or directory at a line.
#
# db_bckup.sh -d <database_name>. It uses .settings file to find out where to save
# and what are limits (maxumum number of stored dumps and so on).
#
# Both scripts also copies back ups every "reserved_backup_frequency" (see .settings)
# days to  special directory for reserved backups.
#
# Refer to .settings file for more details.
